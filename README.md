# About

Welcome to NolanOS. This contains cool things, and more. If you arelooking for a light-weight browser for things, try this! It's a great search browser.

This OS is really just a search engine based off of HTML5, this is mainly worked on with microsoft visual studio code.

# How to use
The website is mainly on replit, but if you choose to use github it's fine. Find system.html and open that, and there you go! All the same features, but on a file.
